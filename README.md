# UIB_Week_Planner

This is just a small application which gets the schedule for a subjects at the university of Bergen.
It can then take those subjects store them locally and give you all possibly schedules in which all subjects fit. 
The application is still nowhere done and is intended to have a GUI and different setting to create a schedule you want. 

The structure of the plans.json file, which is generated when you save a subject, is as follows.
The subject code which contains all the different groups and lectures. Each group or lecture contains all the different weeks the group/lecture meets represented by their week number. Each week contains the different events/occurences of that group aka when the group has a session.
